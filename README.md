    As far as I learned about git branching, I can't push or pull the only newly created branch except doing some changes. If I create any branch in the git or github    file and edit theme then I have to stage that changes and commit that. Than I will be able to push or pull the changes with the newly created branch. The best practice   is to merge the branches after commiting. And then push or pull the changes.
